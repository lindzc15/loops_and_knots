# Loops & Knots
Loops & Knots is a web application designed to allow users to keep track of their favorite patterns and yarns
for crocheting and knitting. Users can browse, search, and filter yarns and patterns. They can then save these
patterns in their own library.

## Other Notes
- I am using MacOS
- The following user is added in the database setup and can be used for testing:
```
username: test_user
name: User
email: test@test
password: test123
```
- Here are some sample API calls to make for testing purposes
```
http://localhost:8080/
request body: none
return:  {
    "message": "Hello from FastAPI!"
}
```

```
http://localhost:8080/api/login
request body:   {
    "username": "test_user",
    "password": "test123"
}
sample return: 
{
    "success": true,
    "jwt_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0X3VzZXIiLCJleHAiOjE3NTg5MDcyNDMsInVzZXIiOnsidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJ0ZXN0X3VzZXIiLCJuYW1lIjoiVXNlciIsImVtYWlsIjoidGVzdEB0ZXN0In19.lLZA8Oa58_ymuPQG8GXVP6s4PJVGA6s8BgPilaC8YJg"
